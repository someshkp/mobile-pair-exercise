This exercise asks the candidate to explore the different ways this piece of work could be approached.

Problem statement:

```
Members want to be able to see Visits and attendance inside the profile screen

This task is not intended to be completed, so no need to rush through it.

Considerations

- Input for a trainer field
    Data input has to be fetched from the API defined as `STAFF_ENDPOINT`

- Basic validations are contained in the config const

- Submit data to the API defined as `APPOINTMENT_ENDPOINT`

- Style the inputs!!, free to add whatever you think it looks good in a consistent reusable way.
